# ASKITE: Aero-structural coupled kite simulator

[![Python package testing](https://github.com/jellepoland/kitesim/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jellepoland/kitesim/actions/workflows/testing.yml)


## Purpose

This code is designed for aero-structural coupled simulations, which can be utilized in the kite design process to determine the performance characteristics of soft-wing kites without the need for actual flight testing.
It includes the [TU Delft V3 Kite](https://awegroup.github.io/TUDELFT_V3_KITE/) as an example, and relies primarly on:

## Main Simulation Workflow

The typical workflow consists of:

1. **Running a simulation**: Use `examples/run_simulation.py` to set up, run, and save a new simulation. This script:
	- Loads configuration and geometry from YAML files in `data/`.
	- Initializes aerodynamic and structural models (using modules in `src/kitesim/`).
	- Runs the coupled aero-structural solver.
	- Saves results to an HDF5 file in the results directory.

2. **Loading and analyzing results**: Use `examples/load_simulation.py` to load a previously saved simulation output and visualize or post-process the results. This script:
	- Loads the HDF5 results file.
	- Prints summary information about the run.
	- Provides interactive 3D visualization of the kite structure and its evolution.

## Details for `src/` Directory

The `src/kitesim/` directory contains the main simulation modules:

| Module                        | Purpose |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| aerodynamic.py                | Aerodynamic model setup and calculations |
| aerostructural_coupled_solver.py | Main coupled solver for aero-structural simulation |
| structural_pss.py             | Structural solver using the Particle System Simulator (PSS) |
| structural_pyfe3d.py          | Structural solver using pyfe3d (alternative) |
| aero2struc.py                 | Mapping between aerodynamic and structural meshes |
| read_struc_geometry_yaml.py   | Utilities for reading geometry and configuration from YAML |
| plotting.py                   | 3D and interactive plotting utilities |
| tracking.py                   | Tracking and post-processing of simulation data |
| utils.py                      | General utilities (file I/O, config, etc.) |
| logging_config.py             | Logging setup for the package |
| solver.py, struc2aero.py      | Additional solver and mapping utilities |
| __init__.py                   | Package initialization |

## Example Usage

To run a new simulation:

```bash
python examples/run_simulation.py
```

To load and interactively analyze a previous simulation:

```bash
python examples/load_simulation.py
```

See the docstrings in those scripts for more details on their workflow and configuration.

## Dependencies
See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)

**Machine Learning**

The code base is adapted to work with a machine learning model trained on more than a hundred thousands Reynolds-average Navier Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations made for leading-edge inflatable airfoils, documented in the MSc. thesis of [K.R.G. Masure](https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:865d59fc-ccff-462e-9bac-e81725f1c0c9), the [code base is also open-source accessible](https://github.com/awegroup/Pointwise-Openfoam-toolchain).

As the three trained models, for Reynolds number = 1e6, 5e6 and 1e7 are too large (~2.3GB) for GitHub, they have to be downloaded separately, and added to the `data/ml_models` folder. They are accessible trough [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16925758), and so is the [CFD data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16925833) on which the models are trained. More description on its usages is found in [Airfoil Aerodynamics](docs/AirfoilAerodynamics.md).
